## **1. COVID Detection**
	Objective:
		The COVID Detection project aims to classify COVID-19 patients using chest X-ray images. The goal is to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that accurately identifies COVID-19 cases from other lung diseases.

	Key Features:
		- Dataset pre-processing (image resizing, normalization, augmentation)
		- CNN architecture built using TensorFlow and Keras
		- Model performance evaluation through confusion matrices and classification reports
		- Visualization of training and validation loss and accuracy
## **2. Digit Recognizer**
	Objective:
		The Digit Recognizer project aims to classify handwritten digits from the popular MNIST dataset. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in recognizing digits (0-9) using deep learning models.

	Key Features:
		- Data pre-processing with normalization and reshaping
		- CNN model built using Keras and TensorFlow
		- Evaluation using accuracy metrics and confusion matrix
		- Visualization of correctly and incorrectly classified digits
## **3. Sentiment Analysis (NLP)**
	Objective:
		The Sentiment Analysis project aims to classify text reviews as positive or negative using NLP techniques. The project focuses on analyzing sentiment in a dataset of text reviews using machine learning models.

	Key Features:
		- Text pre-processing (tokenization, removing stopwords, stemming)
		- Word embedding using techniques like TF-IDF
		- Model training using machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.)
		- Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
